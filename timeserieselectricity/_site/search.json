This allows a quick comparison of the magnitude and variability of each source. Of the top five sources, two are fossil-fuel based (Gas and Hard Coal). Nuclear is a unique source in that it has the largest average hourly generation but a relatively low standard deviation, compared to other major sources. This combination of high mean and low variability is best summarised by the coefficient of variation (CV) statistic, calculated as the standard deviation divided by the mean and then multiplied by 100. Nuclear has the lowest CV out of all sources. Wind Onshore has the largest variability in hourly output, followed by Gas. Solar, however, is a source with very strong seasonality, and this is shown by its higher CV than both Wind Onshore and Gas.\nAs discussed in the Background section, understanding interdependencies between electricity generation sources is important to maintaining energy availability in the short- and medium-term, but also to manage energy transition in the long-term. We calculated Pearson correlation coefficients as a way of investigating linear associations in the dataset. (NB: Due to the autocorrelation properties of time series data, these should be interpreted with caution, but can still give insights into associations.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNuclear, the largest overall contributor to electricity generation, does not have any significant correlations (here defined as correlations with absolute value greater than 0.3). Therefore, not only is Nuclear an incredibly steady generation source, it is also one that does not obviously depend on or affect the amount of electricity produced by other sources. Solar, on the other hand, is a much more variable source, but also has no significant correlations, showing it is also a very independent generation method.\nThree generation sources that are very dependent, or closely related to other sources, are Hard Coal, Hydro River, and Other Renewable, shown by their large number of significant correlations on the correlation plot. The strongest linear association in the dataset is a positive correlation of 0.77 between Hard Coal and Lignite. Lignite is another type of coal, so it makes sense that these two sources would change in tandem. Other correlations are investigated further in the discussion of the time series plots in the next section."

    "text": "Time series visualisation\nThe R Shiny dashboard (https://danielpetterson.shinyapps.io/scripts/) accompanies this section of the EDA. The dashboard allows interactive exploration of each electricity generation source over time, with customisation of which time period to look at, how to average the data, and how to compare the variables. Here we focus on the most interesting patterns.\nThe plot below shows the five sources with the greatest long-term change over the four-year period. (These five sources also happen to have the lowest mean hourly values of the 14 studied in this dataset.)\n\n\n\n\nMonthly averages of Biomass, Oil, Other, Other Renewable, and Waste\n\n\n\nBiomass, Oil, and Other generation sources all show a rapid decrease from a high in 2015 to a low in early 2016, followed by a relatively constant long-term trend for the rest of the series. On the other hand, Waste and Other renewable sources show a sustained increase from 2015 to early 2017, and again followed by a relatively constant long-term trend for the remainder of the series. The similar or opposite nature of the trends between these generation sources are reflected in strong positive or negative correlations. For example, Biomass and Other sources have the second strongest positive linear association of any two sources in the data, with a correlation of 0.66. Meanwhile, the opposing trends mean that Biomass and Other Renewable sources have the strongest negative linear association of any two sources, with a correlation of -0.56.\nUnlike with Hard Coal and Lignite, or Hydro River and Hydro Reservoir, it is not immediately obvious why these sources follow similar or opposite trends. Also, due to their low contribution to overall electricity generation, these marked long-term trends do not have a large effect on total energy output.\nHard Coal and Hydro River, as shown in the correlation plot, are two sources with several large correlations with other sources. The plot below shows some examples of this interdependence, by plotting the mean-centered variation over time of Hard Coal, Hydro River, and Hydro Reservoir.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDue to the way the peaks and troughs of each source tend to either be in phase or 180\\(^\\circ\\) out of phase, we clearly observe a close positive correlation between the two Hydro sources (correlation = 0.65), and a negative correlation between Hard Coal and both these sources (correlation with Hydro River = -0.5, with Hydro Reservoir = -0.16). The reason behind these relationships is likely to be that a more reliable energy source such as coal is used to generate electricity when renewable (and therefore more desired) sources such as hydro power have lower output than is needed.\nThe most obvious seasonality we detected was for Solar generation. In fact, Solar displayed seasonality on two different scales. In the following plot below we can see that this source is seasonal on a daily scale, peaking at around 4000-5000MW/hour between 12pm and 2pm and reaching a low of 40-600MW/hour between 11pm and 6pm. This is an intuitive periodicity: solar plants produce most electricity when they are receiving the most sunlight around noon, and much less during the night when it is dark.\n\n\n\n\nHourly averages of Solar (subset from July 2018)\n\n\n\nIn the next plot we can see that Solar is also seasonal on a monthly scale. Electricity generation by solar peaks at around 2000MW in June or July each year, and hits a low of between 800MW and 1000MW in November or December each year. Once again, this periodicity makes intuitive sense, with higher generation in the summer months and lower generation in the winter months.\n\n\n\n\nMonthly averages of Solar\n\n\n\nFrom background research we learnt that although Spain was an early pioneer in renewable energy, changes in government policy, including the reduction of financial incentives, have stymied the growth of renewable energy capacity in the country. This is especially true for solar power plants, which have remained at a similar generation capacity between 2011 and 2017 [6].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the above plot we can see that total daily power generated from photovoltaic solar systems shows little change across the years we investigated. The similarity of high peaks in winter and summer is likely due to almost all of the solar generation capacity in Spain being photovoltaic rather than thermal: while there are less sunlight hours in winter, the amount and intensity of sun would be similar in the middle of the day. In fact, solar panels are less efficient in the high temperatures of Spanish summers, but no clear evidence for this was found in the data.\nWhile other seasonal effects are less clear, by deconstructing the signal we could find overarching trends, variance, and some degree of seasonality in most of the data. The signal decomposition for our natural hydro sources is shown below. A clear, yearly seasonal cycle is shown, likely demonstrating the existence of a wet and dry season in Spain. On top of this a repeated monthly spike and drop is seen, likely due to some form of maintenance cycle. By overlaying the smoothed seasonal variation with Solar (plot title “Seasonal Contribution”), we can see that they are roughly anti-phased. While this will help to provide a constant year-round supply, the magnitude difference suggests that there will be some residual seasonal signal present in the other generation sources, given the assumption of constant year-round generation of electricity. This is seen in further signal decomposition, and would help to explain the strong negative correlation between hydro sources and many hydrocarbon energy sources.\n\n\n\n\nSignal Decomposition of Hydro Sources\n\n\n\n\nProportion of fossil fuel usage over time\nOverall we see a number of trends, further to the seasonality deficit, that underlie the fossil fuel usage over time. As shown below, once seasonality and variance are removed, all display a trend of decreasing to mid 2016, then increasing to mid 2017 before decreasing again While the inflection points are not identical, they are extremely similar, which can likely be partially explained by common political factors. The first inflection point centres around June 2016, the time of a Spanish general election with issues centering around green energy and environmental friendliness. Articles talk about the drive at the time to support renewable energy and the uncertainty in the fossil fuel sector, which lead to a diversification away from them [7]. Following this Spain had an exceptionally dry year [8], leading to the much lower seasonal peak seen in hydro, and we see a steady increase in fossil fuel sources to compensate. In early 2017, the Spanish government implemented the energy efficiency action plan [9], which reaffirms and incentivises the use of non-fossil fuel based energy. Combined with increased rainfall, this diversification away from fossil fuels lead to a decrease in the electricity generated by them.\n\n\n\n\nSignal Decomposition of Hydro Sources\n\n\n\nWhile the total amount of power generated from fossil fuels varies over time in response to the shortfall between renewables/nuclear and consumer demand, there is a very clear inverse relationship between the proportion of power produced from Liquid Natural Gas (LNG) and the proportion produced from Hard Coal. The rise in LNG usage is likely driven by dropping prices and the availability of infrastructure to import it en masse, given that Spain is home to one third of Europe’s LNG import capacity [10]."
