The app allows interactive visualisation and comparison of each time series, and is discussed in greater detail in the section [Time series visualisation].\n\n# Background\n\nThe following time series concerns electricity generation in Spain over a four-year period. This data originally comes from the \"ENTSO-E Transparency Platform\" dashboard [@entso]. ENTSO stands for *European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity*, and this website is the central collection and visualisation repository of electricity generation, transportation and consumption data across Europe. European Member States are required to submit this data to this platform. This time series covers energy generation from the start of 2015 to the end of 2018.\n\nThe raw dataset contained variables for electricity consumption, generation, and pricing, recorded every hour of the four years, as well as day-ahead forecasts. This report only pertains to the generation of electricity, which is divided into several different generation sources/methods.\n\nThe guiding question for this exploratory data analysis is as follows:\n\n**How does the amount of electricity generated by different sources change over time, individually and with respect to other sources?**\n\nThis question is worth investigating due to the pressing global challenge of climate change, and the consequent need for countries to transition to sustainable energy sources. In order for this to be possible, we need to understand how electricity is currently being generated and what the long-term trends are, to see whether a nation's energy policy should continue or diverge from the current trajectory. Furthermore, governments need to know how electricity generation sources vary seasonally and what interdependencies there are.\n\nIn 2009 Spain became subject to EU Directive 2009/28/EC which mandates an EU-wide commitment to expanding the use of renewable energy [@eudir]. The target was for 20% of all energy consumed in the bloc to be generated by renewable sources by 2020. The Spanish government subsequently published the Plan de Energias Renovables 2011-2020 outlining how it planned to meet its commitments [@plandeenergias]. The amount of energy generated each year that our data covers does not significantly change, but the composition of its generation sources is changing in favor of renewable sources [@sistemaelectrico2016; @sistemaelectrico2018].\n\n# Data\n\nAfter removing the variables that were not relevant to the analysis, and those that contained no observations, the dataset comprised one date-time index variable and 14 numeric variables, corresponding to 14 different electricity generation sources (solar, nuclear, etc.). Each variable contained hourly recordings of the amount of power generated by that source, in megawatts (MW), in Spain, between January 1st 2015 and December 31st 2018. This equates to about 35,000 observations for each source.\n\nAs well as some missing values (discussed further below), there were some outliers in the data. Interestingly, these occurred across variables at the exact same timestamps: there are 3 rows in the raw dataset in which all but one generation source recorded a value of 0. This is shown in the plot below of three days in November 2017, where three negative spikes to zero for all sources except Gas clearly stand out.\n\n<!--<center>![](./figures/strange_zeros.png){width=\"100%\"}</center>-->\n\n```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '100%'}\nknitr::include_graphics(\"./figures/strange_zeros.png\", error = FALSE)\n```\n\nAs these observations are very unlikely to be true values, they were assumed to be incorrectly coded as non-missing and were removed. There are also two other rows where values were a significant departure from the typical range of that source, but were not equal to zero. Since these values are less clearly erroneous, they have not been removed.\n\nAfter removing the outliers, there was a small amount of missing data (256 observations in total). Each variable had between 18 and 22 missing values, which occurred across a total of 26 rows/hours. Just like the outliers described above, most of these missing values occurred across variables: there were 21 rows where data for all or all but one variables were missing, and five rows where only one variable was missing. The missing data did not appear to have any structure, but it was more common towards the start of the time series. Because most of the missing values were isolated, we were confident in imputing them using linear interpolation. However, there was one area of slight concern: of the 26 rows with missing data, six of them were consecutive. The plots below show how this interpolation affected two of the variables.\n\n```{r interpolation plot 1}\n# Creating interpolation indicator vars\ndata$interp_gas <- as.integer(is.na(unimputed_data$generation.fossil.gas))\ndata$interp_solar <- as.integer(is.na(unimputed_data$generation.solar))\n\n# Note that using geom_point is strictly more accurate than geom_line\nggplot(data[50:150,]) + geom_point(aes(x= time, y = Solar, colour = interp_solar), show.legend = FALSE) + scale_color_gradient(low=\"black\", high=\"red\") + labs(x = '', title = \"Solar variable post-linear interpolation of largest gap\") +\n  theme_minimal()+\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) \n```\n\nThe plot above, with interpolated values in red, clearly shows that linear interpolation over the adjacent missing values did not follow the strong seasonal pattern observed for this variable.\n\n```{r interpolation plot 2}\nggplot(data[50:150,]) + geom_point(aes(x= time, y = `Gas`, colour = interp_solar), show.legend = FALSE) + scale_color_gradient(low=\"black\", high=\"red\") + labs(x = '', title = \"Gas variable post-linear interpolation of largest gap\") +\n  theme_minimal()+\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) \n\n# Removing indicator vars\ndata <- data %>% select(-c(interp_gas, interp_solar))\n```\n\nThe linear interpolation over the adjacent missing values in the Gas variable looks as if it may also result in some distortion of the fluctuation in this variable, but it is less obvious than for Solar.\n\nOverall, despite linear interpolation not following the trend of the data for some variables, this gap represents a very small proportion of each time series (less than 0.02% of the series), so we were content to make this small distortion of the data and apply the interpolation method consistently across each variable.\n\n# Exploratory Data Analysis\n\nIn the first section, [Summary statistics], we look at statistics for each source over the entire time series, and calculate correlations between sources.\n\nIn the second section, [Time series visualisation], we investigate some of these correlations, using charts to compare how different sources vary over time with respect to one another. Here we also examine notable long-term trends and seasonality.\n\n## Summary statistics\n\n```{r summary stats, echo=FALSE}\n# Changing the order of the variables from largest to smallest\ndata_table <- data %>% select(c(\"Nuclear\", \"Gas\", \"Wind Onshore\", \"Hard Coal\", \"Hydro Reservoir\", \"Solar\", \"Hydro River\", \"Lignite\", \"Hydro Pumped\", \"Biomass\", \"Oil\", \"Waste\", \"Other Renewable\", \"Other\"))\n# Creating CV statistic function\nCV <- function(x) sd(x)*100/mean(x)\nf <- All(data_table) ~ Mean + SD + CV + Min + Median + Max + Histogram\ndatasummary(f, data_table, output=\"markdown\", fmt =  0)\n```\n\nThe table above shows summary statistics (to 0dp) for every generation source in the dataset, ordered from largest to smallest mean hourly value. This allows a quick comparison of the magnitude and variability of each source. Of the top five sources, two are fossil-fuel based (Gas and Hard Coal). Nuclear is a unique source in that it has the largest average hourly generation but a relatively low standard deviation, compared to other major sources. This combination of high mean and low variability is best summarised by the coefficient of variation (CV) statistic, calculated as the standard deviation divided by the mean and then multiplied by 100. Nuclear has the lowest CV out of all sources. Wind Onshore has the largest variability in hourly output, followed by Gas. Solar, however, is a source with very strong seasonality, and this is shown by its higher CV than both Wind Onshore and Gas.\n\nAs discussed in the [Background] section, understanding interdependencies between electricity generation sources is important to maintaining energy availability in the short- and medium-term, but also to manage energy transition in the long-term. We calculated Pearson correlation coefficients as a way of investigating linear associations in the dataset. (NB: Due to the autocorrelation properties of time series data, these should be interpreted with caution, but can still give insights into associations.)\n\n```{r correlation plot, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}\n# Correlation plot\ndf_corr <- data[,2:ncol(data)]\n\ncorrmatrix <- df_corr %>% cor()\ncorrplot(corrmatrix, method = \"color\", addCoef.col=\"black\", order = \"FPC\", number.cex= 0.5, tl.cex=0.5, tl.col = \"black\", type = 'lower', cl.pos = 'b',\n         title = \"Pearson correlation coefficients to 2dp\", mar=c(0,0,1,0))\n```\n\nNuclear, the largest overall contributor to electricity generation, does not have any significant correlations (here defined as correlations with absolute value greater than 0.3). Therefore, not only is Nuclear an incredibly steady generation source, it is also one that does not obviously depend on or affect the amount of electricity produced by other sources. Solar, on the other hand, is a much more variable source, but also has no significant correlations, showing it is also a very independent generation method.\n\nThree generation sources that are very *dependent*, or closely related to other sources, are Hard Coal, Hydro River, and Other Renewable, shown by their large number of significant correlations on the correlation plot. The strongest linear association in the dataset is a positive correlation of 0.77 between Hard Coal and Lignite. Lignite is another type of coal, so it makes sense that these two sources would change in tandem. Other correlations are investigated further in the discussion of the time series plots in the next section.\n\n## Time series visualisation\n\nThe R Shiny dashboard (<https://danielpetterson.shinyapps.io/scripts/)> accompanies this section of the EDA. The dashboard allows interactive exploration of each electricity generation source over time, with customisation of which time period to look at, how to average the data, and how to compare the variables. Here we focus on the most interesting patterns.\n\nThe plot below shows the five sources with the greatest long-term change over the four-year period. (These five sources also happen to have the lowest mean hourly values of the 14 studied in this dataset.)\n\n<center>\n\n![**Monthly averages of Biomass, Oil, Other, Other Renewable, and Waste**](./figures/5_sources.png){width=\"100%\"}\n\n</center>\n\nBiomass, Oil, and Other generation sources all show a rapid decrease from a high in 2015 to a low in early 2016, followed by a relatively constant long-term trend for the rest of the series. On the other hand, Waste and Other renewable sources show a sustained increase from 2015 to early 2017, and again followed by a relatively constant long-term trend for the remainder of the series. The similar or opposite nature of the trends between these generation sources are reflected in strong positive or negative correlations. For example, Biomass and Other sources have the second strongest positive linear association of any two sources in the data, with a correlation of 0.66. Meanwhile, the opposing trends mean that Biomass and Other Renewable sources have the strongest negative linear association of any two sources, with a correlation of -0.56.\n\nUnlike with Hard Coal and Lignite, or Hydro River and Hydro Reservoir, it is not immediately obvious why these sources follow similar or opposite trends. Also, due to their low contribution to overall electricity generation, these marked long-term trends do not have a large effect on total energy output.\n\nHard Coal and Hydro River, as shown in the correlation plot, are two sources with several large correlations with other sources. The plot below shows some examples of this interdependence, by plotting the mean-centered variation over time of Hard Coal, Hydro River, and Hydro Reservoir.\n\n```{r mean centered}\ncenter_scale <- function(x) {\n  scale(x, scale=FALSE)\n}\n\ndata_centered <- data %>%\n  select(c(\"Hard Coal\", \"Hydro Reservoir\", \"Hydro River\")) %>%\n  mutate_all(., center_scale) %>%\n  mutate(time = data$time) %>%\n  pivot_longer(cols = -time, names_to = \"generation_source\") %>% \n  group_by(generation_source) %>% \n  summarise_by_time(time, .by = \"month\", adjusted = mean(value))\n\nggplot(data_centered)+\n  geom_line(aes(x=time, y=adjusted, color=generation_source))+\n  geom_hline(yintercept=0, linetype=\"dashed\")+\n  labs(x=\"Time\", y=\"Difference from Mean (MW)\", title=\"Mean Centered Variation Over Time\")+\n  scale_color_discrete(name = \"Generation\\nMethod\") +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),panel.background = element_rect(fill = 'white', color = 'white')) \n```\n\n</center>\n\nDue to the way the peaks and troughs of each source tend to either be in phase or 180$^\\circ$ out of phase, we clearly observe a close positive correlation between the two Hydro sources (correlation = 0.65), and a negative correlation between Hard Coal and both these sources (correlation with Hydro River = -0.5, with Hydro Reservoir = -0.16). The reason behind these relationships is likely to be that a more reliable energy source such as coal is used to generate electricity when renewable (and therefore more desired) sources such as hydro power have lower output than is needed.\n\nThe most obvious seasonality we detected was for Solar generation. In fact, Solar displayed seasonality on two different scales. In the following plot below we can see that this source is seasonal on a daily scale, peaking at around 4000-5000MW/hour between 12pm and 2pm and reaching a low of 40-600MW/hour between 11pm and 6pm. This is an intuitive periodicity: solar plants produce most electricity when they are receiving the most sunlight around noon, and much less during the night when it is dark.\n\n<center>\n\n![**Hourly averages of Solar (subset from July 2018)**](./figures/solar_hourly.png){width=\"100%\"}\n\n</center>\n\nIn the next plot we can see that Solar is also seasonal on a monthly scale. Electricity generation by solar peaks at around 2000MW in June or July each year, and hits a low of between 800MW and 1000MW in November or December each year. Once again, this periodicity makes intuitive sense, with higher generation in the summer months and lower generation in the winter months.\n\n<center>\n\n![**Monthly averages of Solar**](./figures/solar_monthly.png){width=\"100%\"}\n\n</center>\n\nFrom background research we learnt that although Spain was an early pioneer in renewable energy, changes in government policy, including the reduction of financial incentives, have stymied the growth of renewable energy capacity in the country. This is especially true for solar power plants, which have remained at a similar generation capacity between 2011 and 2017 [@GURTLER2019110881].\n\n```{r solar daily total}\ndata %>%\n  mutate(Year=year(time), Month=month(time), Day=day(time)) %>%\n  select(c(Year, Month, Day, Solar)) %>%\n  mutate(Date=as.Date(with(., paste(Year, Month, Day,sep=\"-\")), \"%Y-%m-%d\")) %>%\n  group_by(Date) %>%\n  summarise(Solar=sum(Solar)) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x=Date, y=Solar))+\n  geom_line()+\n  labs(x=\"Date\", y=\"Power Generated (MW)\", title=\"Total Photovoltaic Power Generation per Day\")+\n  scale_colour_viridis_d() +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),panel.background = element_rect(fill = 'white', color = 'white')) \n```\n\nFrom the above plot we can see that total daily power generated from photovoltaic solar systems shows little change across the years we investigated. The similarity of high peaks in winter and summer is likely due to almost all of the solar generation capacity in Spain being photovoltaic rather than thermal: while there are less sunlight hours in winter, the amount and intensity of sun would be similar in the middle of the day. In fact, solar panels are less efficient in the high temperatures of Spanish summers, but no clear evidence for this was found in the data.\n\nWhile other seasonal effects are less clear, by deconstructing the signal we could find overarching trends, variance, and some degree of seasonality in most of the data. The signal decomposition for our natural hydro sources is shown below. A clear, yearly seasonal cycle is shown, likely demonstrating the existence of a wet and dry season in Spain. On top of this a repeated monthly spike and drop is seen, likely due to some form of maintenance cycle. By overlaying the smoothed seasonal variation with Solar (plot title \"Seasonal Contribution\"), we can see that they are roughly anti-phased. While this will help to provide a constant year-round supply, the magnitude difference suggests that there will be some residual seasonal signal present in the other generation sources, given the assumption of constant year-round generation of electricity. This is seen in further signal decomposition, and would help to explain the strong negative correlation between hydro sources and many hydrocarbon energy sources.\n\n<center>\n\n![**Signal Decomposition of Hydro Sources**](./figures/hydro_season.png){width=\"100%\"}\n\n</center>\n\n#### Proportion of fossil fuel usage over time\n\nOverall we see a number of trends, further to the seasonality deficit, that underlie the fossil fuel usage over time. As shown below, once seasonality and variance are removed, all display a trend of decreasing to mid 2016, then increasing to mid 2017 before decreasing again While the inflection points are not identical, they are extremely similar, which can likely be partially explained by common political factors. The first inflection point centres around June 2016, the time of a Spanish general election with issues centering around green energy and environmental friendliness. Articles talk about the drive at the time to support renewable energy and the uncertainty in the fossil fuel sector, which lead to a diversification away from them [@fitch]. Following this Spain had an exceptionally dry year [@fernandez_2021], leading to the much lower seasonal peak seen in hydro, and we see a steady increase in fossil fuel sources to compensate. In early 2017, the Spanish government implemented the energy efficiency action plan [@government_2017], which reaffirms and incentivises the use of non-fossil fuel based energy. Combined with increased rainfall, this diversification away from fossil fuels lead to a decrease in the electricity generated by them.\n\n<center>\n\n![**Signal Decomposition of Hydro Sources**](./figures/fossil_trends.png){width=\"100%\"}\n\n</center>\n\nWhile the total amount of power generated from fossil fuels varies over time in response to the shortfall between renewables/nuclear and consumer demand, there is a very clear inverse relationship between the proportion of power produced from Liquid Natural Gas (LNG) and the proportion produced from Hard Coal. The rise in LNG usage is likely driven by dropping prices and the availability of infrastructure to import it en masse, given that Spain is home to one third of Europe's LNG import capacity [@lng].\n\n```{r test}\nfossil <- data %>%\n  select(c(Biomass,`Hard Coal`, Lignite, Gas, Oil))\n\ncbind(data[1], prop.table(as.matrix(fossil), margin = 1)) %>%\n  pivot_longer(cols = -time, names_to = \"generation_source\") %>%\n  group_by(generation_source) %>% \n  summarise_by_time(time, .by = '1 month', adjusted = mean(value)) %>% \n  ggplot() + \n  geom_line(aes(x = time, y = adjusted, color = generation_source), stat = \"identity\") +\n  labs(x=\"Date\", y=\"Proportion\", title=\"Proportion of Power from Fossil Fuels by Type\")+\n  scale_colour_viridis_d(name = \"Fuel Type\") +\n  theme_minimal()+\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) \n\n```\n\n# Conclusion\n\nAn exploratory data analysis of electricity generation in Spain between 2015 and 2018 was conducted to investigate how generation by different sources has changed over time. This dataset required cleaning of a small number of missing values and outliers; these were filled in using linear interpolation. We found that Nuclear was the most important generation source over the period, not only due to its high mean output but also its low variability. A number of low-output sources showed significant long-term change in their average output. Seasonality was observed in solar generation (on two scales), and to a lesser extent in hydroelectric sources. The overall generation amount remained roughly constant for Spain and as such this seasonality induced compensatory seasonality in some of the fossil fuel sources. This analysis could help inform government policy around clean energy investment, and there were some concerns around ethical implications of how this research could affect future policy around climate change and affordable energy.\n\n# References\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n<!--  -->\n```{r setup, include=FALSE}\nknitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE, fig.align = 'center')\n```\n\n```{r libraries, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}\n# Load libraries\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(magrittr)\nlibrary(lubridate)\nlibrary(imputeTS)\nlibrary(modelsummary)\nlibrary(corrplot)\nlibrary(plotly)\nlibrary(timetk)\nlibrary(seastests)\nlibrary(ggfortify)\nlibrary(zoo)\nlibrary(tseries)\nlibrary(astsa)\nlibrary(BBmisc)\nlibrary(forecast)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n```\n\n```{r data, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}\ndf <- read.csv(\"./data/energy_dataset.csv\")\n\n# Change to datetime var\ndf$time <- as_datetime(df$time, tz=\"CET\")\n\n# Removing variables with no values\nunimputed_data <- df %>%\n  select(-c(generation.fossil.coal.derived.gas,\n                    generation.fossil.oil.shale,\n                    generation.fossil.peat,\n                    generation.geothermal,\n                    generation.marine,\n                    generation.hydro.pumped.storage.aggregated,\n                    generation.wind.offshore,\n                    forecast.wind.offshore.eday.ahead)) \n\n# Removing outliers\noutlier_rows <- unimputed_data[unimputed_data$time %in% ymd_hms('2017-11-12 20:00:00', '2017-11-14 11:00:00', '2017-11-14 18:00:00'),]\n\noutlier_rows[outlier_rows == 0] <- NA\n\nunimputed_data_cleaner <- unimputed_data\n\nunimputed_data_cleaner[unimputed_data_cleaner$time %in% ymd_hms('2017-11-12 20:00:00', '2017-11-14 11:00:00', '2017-11-14 18:00:00'),] <- outlier_rows\n\n# Interpolating missing values\ndata <- unimputed_data_cleaner %>% \n          mutate(across(generation.biomass:price.actual, .fns = na_interpolation, option = 'linear')) %>% \n          select(c(1, starts_with(\"generation\")))\n\n# Giving vars simpler names\nnames(data) <- c(\"time\",\n                 \"Biomass\",\n                 \"Lignite\",\n                 \"Gas\",\n                 \"Hard Coal\",\n                 \"Oil\",\n                 \"Hydro Pumped\",\n                 \"Hydro River\",\n                 \"Hydro Reservoir\",\n                 \"Nuclear\",\n                 \"Other\",\n                 \"Other Renewable\",\n                 \"Solar\",\n                 \"Waste\",\n                 \"Wind Onshore\")\n        \n\ndata_long <- data %>% pivot_longer(cols = -time, names_to = \"generation_source\")\n```\n\nThis report is accompanied by an [online dashboard](https://danielpetterson.shinyapps.io/scripts/), developed in R Shiny.

The amount of energy generated each year that our data covers does not significantly change, but the composition of its generation sources is changing in favor of renewable sources [@sistemaelectrico2016; @sistemaelectrico2018].\n\n# Data\n\nAfter removing the variables that were not relevant to the analysis, and those that contained no observations, the dataset comprised one date-time index variable and 14 numeric variables, corresponding to 14 different electricity generation sources (solar, nuclear, etc.). Each variable contained hourly recordings of the amount of power generated by that source, in megawatts (MW), in Spain, between January 1st 2015 and December 31st 2018. This equates to about 35,000 observations for each source.\n\nAs well as some missing values (discussed further below), there were some outliers in the data. Interestingly, these occurred across variables at the exact same timestamps: there are 3 rows in the raw dataset in which all but one generation source recorded a value of 0. This is shown in the plot below of three days in November 2017, where three negative spikes to zero for all sources except Gas clearly stand out.\n\n<!--<center>![](./figures/strange_zeros.png){width=\"100%\"}</center>-->\n\n```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '100%'}\nknitr::include_graphics(\"./figures/strange_zeros.png\", error = FALSE)\n```\n\nAs these observations are very unlikely to be true values, they were assumed to be incorrectly coded as non-missing and were removed. There are also two other rows where values were a significant departure from the typical range of that source, but were not equal to zero. Since these values are less clearly erroneous, they have not been removed.\n\nAfter removing the outliers, there was a small amount of missing data (256 observations in total). Each variable had between 18 and 22 missing values, which occurred across a total of 26 rows/hours. Just like the outliers described above, most of these missing values occurred across variables: there were 21 rows where data for all or all but one variables were missing, and five rows where only one variable was missing. The missing data did not appear to have any structure, but it was more common towards the start of the time series. Because most of the missing values were isolated, we were confident in imputing them using linear interpolation. However, there was one area of slight concern: of the 26 rows with missing data, six of them were consecutive. The plots below show how this interpolation affected two of the variables.\n\n```{r interpolation plot 1}\n# Creating interpolation indicator vars\ndata$interp_gas <- as.integer(is.na(unimputed_data$generation.fossil.gas))\ndata$interp_solar <- as.integer(is.na(unimputed_data$generation.solar))\n\n# Note that using geom_point is strictly more accurate than geom_line\nggplot(data[50:150,]) + geom_point(aes(x= time, y = Solar, colour = interp_solar), show.legend = FALSE) + scale_color_gradient(low=\"black\", high=\"red\") + labs(x = '', title = \"Solar variable post-linear interpolation of largest gap\") +\n  theme_minimal()+\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) \n```\n\nThe plot above, with interpolated values in red, clearly shows that linear interpolation over the adjacent missing values did not follow the strong seasonal pattern observed for this variable.\n\n```{r interpolation plot 2}\nggplot(data[50:150,]) + geom_point(aes(x= time, y = `Gas`, colour = interp_solar), show.legend = FALSE) + scale_color_gradient(low=\"black\", high=\"red\") + labs(x = '', title = \"Gas variable post-linear interpolation of largest gap\") +\n  theme_minimal()+\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) \n\n# Removing indicator vars\ndata <- data %>% select(-c(interp_gas, interp_solar))\n```\n\nThe linear interpolation over the adjacent missing values in the Gas variable looks as if it may also result in some distortion of the fluctuation in this variable, but it is less obvious than for Solar.\n\nOverall, despite linear interpolation not following the trend of the data for some variables, this gap represents a very small proportion of each time series (less than 0.02% of the series), so we were content to make this small distortion of the data and apply the interpolation method consistently across each variable.\n\n# Exploratory Data Analysis\n\nIn the first section, [Summary statistics], we look at statistics for each source over the entire time series, and calculate correlations between sources.\n\nIn the second section, [Time series visualisation], we investigate some of these correlations, using charts to compare how different sources vary over time with respect to one another. Here we also examine notable long-term trends and seasonality.\n\n## Summary statistics\n\n```{r summary stats, echo=FALSE}\n# Changing the order of the variables from largest to smallest\ndata_table <- data %>% select(c(\"Nuclear\", \"Gas\", \"Wind Onshore\", \"Hard Coal\", \"Hydro Reservoir\", \"Solar\", \"Hydro River\", \"Lignite\", \"Hydro Pumped\", \"Biomass\", \"Oil\", \"Waste\", \"Other Renewable\", \"Other\"))\n# Creating CV statistic function\nCV <- function(x) sd(x)*100/mean(x)\nf <- All(data_table) ~ Mean + SD + CV + Min + Median + Max + Histogram\ndatasummary(f, data_table, output=\"markdown\", fmt =  0)\n```\n\nThe table above shows summary statistics (to 0dp) for every generation source in the dataset, ordered from largest to smallest mean hourly value. This allows a quick comparison of the magnitude and variability of each source. Of the top five sources, two are fossil-fuel based (Gas and Hard Coal). Nuclear is a unique source in that it has the largest average hourly generation but a relatively low standard deviation, compared to other major sources. This combination of high mean and low variability is best summarised by the coefficient of variation (CV) statistic, calculated as the standard deviation divided by the mean and then multiplied by 100. Nuclear has the lowest CV out of all sources. Wind Onshore has the largest variability in hourly output, followed by Gas. Solar, however, is a source with very strong seasonality, and this is shown by its higher CV than both Wind Onshore and Gas.\n\nAs discussed in the [Background] section, understanding interdependencies between electricity generation sources is important to maintaining energy availability in the short- and medium-term, but also to manage energy transition in the long-term. We calculated Pearson correlation coefficients as a way of investigating linear associations in the dataset. (NB: Due to the autocorrelation properties of time series data, these should be interpreted with caution, but can still give insights into associations.)\n\n```{r correlation plot, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}\n# Correlation plot\ndf_corr <- data[,2:ncol(data)]\n\ncorrmatrix <- df_corr %>% cor()\ncorrplot(corrmatrix, method = \"color\", addCoef.col=\"black\", order = \"FPC\", number.cex= 0.5, tl.cex=0.5, tl.col = \"black\", type = 'lower', cl.pos = 'b',\n         title = \"Pearson correlation coefficients to 2dp\", mar=c(0,0,1,0))\n```\n\nNuclear, the largest overall contributor to electricity generation, does not have any significant correlations (here defined as correlations with absolute value greater than 0.3). Therefore, not only is Nuclear an incredibly steady generation source, it is also one that does not obviously depend on or affect the amount of electricity produced by other sources. Solar, on the other hand, is a much more variable source, but also has no significant correlations, showing it is also a very independent generation method.\n\nThree generation sources that are very *dependent*, or closely related to other sources, are Hard Coal, Hydro River, and Other Renewable, shown by their large number of significant correlations on the correlation plot. The strongest linear association in the dataset is a positive correlation of 0.77 between Hard Coal and Lignite. Lignite is another type of coal, so it makes sense that these two sources would change in tandem. Other correlations are investigated further in the discussion of the time series plots in the next section.\n\n## Time series visualisation\n\nThe R Shiny dashboard (<https://danielpetterson.shinyapps.io/scripts/)> accompanies this section of the EDA. The dashboard allows interactive exploration of each electricity generation source over time, with customisation of which time period to look at, how to average the data, and how to compare the variables. Here we focus on the most interesting patterns.\n\nThe plot below shows the five sources with the greatest long-term change over the four-year period. (These five sources also happen to have the lowest mean hourly values of the 14 studied in this dataset.)\n\n<center>\n\n![**Monthly averages of Biomass, Oil, Other, Other Renewable, and Waste**](./figures/5_sources.png){width=\"100%\"}\n\n</center>\n\nBiomass, Oil, and Other generation sources all show a rapid decrease from a high in 2015 to a low in early 2016, followed by a relatively constant long-term trend for the rest of the series. On the other hand, Waste and Other renewable sources show a sustained increase from 2015 to early 2017, and again followed by a relatively constant long-term trend for the remainder of the series. The similar or opposite nature of the trends between these generation sources are reflected in strong positive or negative correlations. For example, Biomass and Other sources have the second strongest positive linear association of any two sources in the data, with a correlation of 0.66. Meanwhile, the opposing trends mean that Biomass and Other Renewable sources have the strongest negative linear association of any two sources, with a correlation of -0.56.\n\nUnlike with Hard Coal and Lignite, or Hydro River and Hydro Reservoir, it is not immediately obvious why these sources follow similar or opposite trends. Also, due to their low contribution to overall electricity generation, these marked long-term trends do not have a large effect on total energy output.\n\nHard Coal and Hydro River, as shown in the correlation plot, are two sources with several large correlations with other sources. The plot below shows some examples of this interdependence, by plotting the mean-centered variation over time of Hard Coal, Hydro River, and Hydro Reservoir.\n\n```{r mean centered}\ncenter_scale <- function(x) {\n  scale(x, scale=FALSE)\n}\n\ndata_centered <- data %>%\n  select(c(\"Hard Coal\", \"Hydro Reservoir\", \"Hydro River\")) %>%\n  mutate_all(., center_scale) %>%\n  mutate(time = data$time) %>%\n  pivot_longer(cols = -time, names_to = \"generation_source\") %>% \n  group_by(generation_source) %>% \n  summarise_by_time(time, .by = \"month\", adjusted = mean(value))\n\nggplot(data_centered)+\n  geom_line(aes(x=time, y=adjusted, color=generation_source))+\n  geom_hline(yintercept=0, linetype=\"dashed\")+\n  labs(x=\"Time\", y=\"Difference from Mean (MW)\", title=\"Mean Centered Variation Over Time\")+\n  scale_color_discrete(name = \"Generation\\nMethod\") +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),panel.background = element_rect(fill = 'white', color = 'white')) \n```\n\n</center>\n\nDue to the way the peaks and troughs of each source tend to either be in phase or 180$^\\circ$ out of phase, we clearly observe a close positive correlation between the two Hydro sources (correlation = 0.65), and a negative correlation between Hard Coal and both these sources (correlation with Hydro River = -0.5, with Hydro Reservoir = -0.16). The reason behind these relationships is likely to be that a more reliable energy source such as coal is used to generate electricity when renewable (and therefore more desired) sources such as hydro power have lower output than is needed.\n\nThe most obvious seasonality we detected was for Solar generation. In fact, Solar displayed seasonality on two different scales. In the following plot below we can see that this source is seasonal on a daily scale, peaking at around 4000-5000MW/hour between 12pm and 2pm and reaching a low of 40-600MW/hour between 11pm and 6pm. This is an intuitive periodicity: solar plants produce most electricity when they are receiving the most sunlight around noon, and much less during the night when it is dark.\n\n<center>\n\n![**Hourly averages of Solar (subset from July 2018)**](./figures/solar_hourly.png){width=\"100%\"}\n\n</center>\n\nIn the next plot we can see that Solar is also seasonal on a monthly scale. Electricity generation by solar peaks at around 2000MW in June or July each year, and hits a low of between 800MW and 1000MW in November or December each year. Once again, this periodicity makes intuitive sense, with higher generation in the summer months and lower generation in the winter months.\n\n<center>\n\n![**Monthly averages of Solar**](./figures/solar_monthly.png){width=\"100%\"}\n\n</center>\n\nFrom background research we learnt that although Spain was an early pioneer in renewable energy, changes in government policy, including the reduction of financial incentives, have stymied the growth of renewable energy capacity in the country. This is especially true for solar power plants, which have remained at a similar generation capacity between 2011 and 2017 [@GURTLER2019110881].\n\n```{r solar daily total}\ndata %>%\n  mutate(Year=year(time), Month=month(time), Day=day(time)) %>%\n  select(c(Year, Month, Day, Solar)) %>%\n  mutate(Date=as.Date(with(., paste(Year, Month, Day,sep=\"-\")), \"%Y-%m-%d\")) %>%\n  group_by(Date) %>%\n  summarise(Solar=sum(Solar)) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x=Date, y=Solar))+\n  geom_line()+\n  labs(x=\"Date\", y=\"Power Generated (MW)\", title=\"Total Photovoltaic Power Generation per Day\")+\n  scale_colour_viridis_d() +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),panel.background = element_rect(fill = 'white', color = 'white')) \n```\n\nFrom the above plot we can see that total daily power generated from photovoltaic solar systems shows little change across the years we investigated. The similarity of high peaks in winter and summer is likely due to almost all of the solar generation capacity in Spain being photovoltaic rather than thermal: while there are less sunlight hours in winter, the amount and intensity of sun would be similar in the middle of the day. In fact, solar panels are less efficient in the high temperatures of Spanish summers, but no clear evidence for this was found in the data.\n\nWhile other seasonal effects are less clear, by deconstructing the signal we could find overarching trends, variance, and some degree of seasonality in most of the data. The signal decomposition for our natural hydro sources is shown below. A clear, yearly seasonal cycle is shown, likely demonstrating the existence of a wet and dry season in Spain. On top of this a repeated monthly spike and drop is seen, likely due to some form of maintenance cycle. By overlaying the smoothed seasonal variation with Solar (plot title \"Seasonal Contribution\"), we can see that they are roughly anti-phased. While this will help to provide a constant year-round supply, the magnitude difference suggests that there will be some residual seasonal signal present in the other generation sources, given the assumption of constant year-round generation of electricity. This is seen in further signal decomposition, and would help to explain the strong negative correlation between hydro sources and many hydrocarbon energy sources.\n\n<center>\n\n![**Signal Decomposition of Hydro Sources**](./figures/hydro_season.png){width=\"100%\"}\n\n</center>\n\n#### Proportion of fossil fuel usage over time\n\nOverall we see a number of trends, further to the seasonality deficit, that underlie the fossil fuel usage over time. As shown below, once seasonality and variance are removed, all display a trend of decreasing to mid 2016, then increasing to mid 2017 before decreasing again While the inflection points are not identical, they are extremely similar, which can likely be partially explained by common political factors. The first inflection point centres around June 2016, the time of a Spanish general election with issues centering around green energy and environmental friendliness. Articles talk about the drive at the time to support renewable energy and the uncertainty in the fossil fuel sector, which lead to a diversification away from them [@fitch]. Following this Spain had an exceptionally dry year [@fernandez_2021], leading to the much lower seasonal peak seen in hydro, and we see a steady increase in fossil fuel sources to compensate. In early 2017, the Spanish government implemented the energy efficiency action plan [@government_2017], which reaffirms and incentivises the use of non-fossil fuel based energy. Combined with increased rainfall, this diversification away from fossil fuels lead to a decrease in the electricity generated by them.\n\n<center>\n\n![**Signal Decomposition of Hydro Sources**](./figures/fossil_trends.png){width=\"100%\"}\n\n</center>\n\nWhile the total amount of power generated from fossil fuels varies over time in response to the shortfall between renewables/nuclear and consumer demand, there is a very clear inverse relationship between the proportion of power produced from Liquid Natural Gas (LNG) and the proportion produced from Hard Coal. The rise in LNG usage is likely driven by dropping prices and the availability of infrastructure to import it en masse, given that Spain is home to one third of Europe's LNG import capacity [@lng].\n\n```{r test}\nfossil <- data %>%\n  select(c(Biomass,`Hard Coal`, Lignite, Gas, Oil))\n\ncbind(data[1], prop.table(as.matrix(fossil), margin = 1)) %>%\n  pivot_longer(cols = -time, names_to = \"generation_source\") %>%\n  group_by(generation_source) %>% \n  summarise_by_time(time, .by = '1 month', adjusted = mean(value)) %>% \n  ggplot() + \n  geom_line(aes(x = time, y = adjusted, color = generation_source), stat = \"identity\") +\n  labs(x=\"Date\", y=\"Proportion\", title=\"Proportion of Power from Fossil Fuels by Type\")+\n  scale_colour_viridis_d(name = \"Fuel Type\") +\n  theme_minimal()+\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) \n\n```\n\n# Conclusion\n\nAn exploratory data analysis of electricity generation in Spain between 2015 and 2018 was conducted to investigate how generation by different sources has changed over time. This dataset required cleaning of a small number of missing values and outliers; these were filled in using linear interpolation. We found that Nuclear was the most important generation source over the period, not only due to its high mean output but also its low variability. A number of low-output sources showed significant long-term change in their average output. Seasonality was observed in solar generation (on two scales), and to a lesser extent in hydroelectric sources. The overall generation amount remained roughly constant for Spain and as such this seasonality induced compensatory seasonality in some of the fossil fuel sources. This analysis could help inform government policy around clean energy investment, and there were some concerns around ethical implications of how this research could affect future policy around climate change and affordable energy.\n\n#
